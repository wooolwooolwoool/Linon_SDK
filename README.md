# About

Linon SDK is drive simulatorâ€‹ sample. The purpose of it is to create an open source simulation environment.

# Summary

Linon SDK consists of Controllor and Simurator (Agent and Enviroment). It provides base of Controlor and Agent. Enviroment expected to be made by User.

Simurator is made by unity. Controllor can be use any language.

The communication method is defined as follows for ease of use.
- UDP communication is used for continuous information that needs to be conveyed in real time.
- TCP communication is used for Event signals.
- MMAP(memory-mapped file) is used to send and receive images.
